To tackle the challenge of increasing F&B service satisfaction for United Airlines, you can use Power BI to perform the analysis and create a presentation for your findings and recommendations. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to proceed:

Step 1: Data Import and Preparation in Power BI

1.1. Import the following datasets into Power BI:

Survey data for inflight satisfaction scores.
Survey data for customer comments/feedback.
Inflight service pre-order data.
Inflight service inventory data (only for Business/First Class).

1.2. Clean and preprocess the data within Power BI:

Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Ensure data types are appropriate for analysis.

Step 2: Descriptive Analysis

2.1. Create visualizations to understand satisfaction scores:

Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of satisfaction scores.
Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for satisfaction scores.

2.2. Identify key drivers of satisfaction:

Use visualizations like scatter plots or correlation matrices to identify relationships between variables (e.g., pre-order rate, inventory levels) and satisfaction scores.
Filter data to focus on the summer months and analyze satisfaction during this period.

Step 3: Customer Comments Analysis

3.1. Text analysis of customer comments:

Use Power BI's text analytics capabilities to perform sentiment analysis on customer comments.
Extract keywords and themes from comments using NLP techniques within Power BI.

3.2. Create visualizations to understand major themes:

Create word clouds or bar charts to visualize the frequency of themes mentioned in customer comments.

Step 4: Root Cause Analysis

4.1. Combine findings from satisfaction scores and customer comments to identify potential root causes of low satisfaction during summer months.

4.2. Use additional data such as pre-order and inventory data to correlate with satisfaction scores within Power BI.

Step 5: SQL/Python/R Queries (using Power Query in Power BI)

5.1. Write Power Query code to:

Summarize satisfaction scores by different attributes (e.g., route, class).
Calculate the percentage of satisfied customers during summer months.
Analyze pre-order and inventory data to identify any issues.





By using Power BI for our analysis and presentation, I have created interactive dashboards and reports that enable stakeholders to explore the data and gain a better understanding of the issues related to F&B service satisfaction. This approach combines data analysis and visualization to drive data-informed decision-making for United Airlines.
